Welcome to the tavern of Krezar!

Here you can relax, have a drink or prove that someone is wrong by challenging him to a duel. \
You can also earn some gold in raids.

Do not hesitate to ask for help, we will be happy to help you."""

raids = """\
In order to participate in raids, you need to add a bot to your group.

After that, at certain intervals, ads will appear in the tavern, \
for participation in which you can earn money. If the raid is successful, then the reward will increase.

And remember! The more seekers there are, the more chances to win!

If you do not want your group to be sent ads during sleep, you can inform the guild of your availability hours \
using ${set_active_time_command} [start_time] [end_time] [time_zone]. Например: <code>${set_active_time_command} 6 24 +3</code>"""

duels = """\
If it seems to you that someone is wrong in the tavern, then there is a special arena behind the tavern for a showdown!
Just reply to the abuser's message with ${duel_command}.

However, know that the arena is not a free pleasure! Someone has to wash her blood off afterwards and remove the knocked-out teeth."""

As in any self-respecting tavern, you can have a drink and a delicious meal here.

Get acquainted with the list of available positions via ${menu_command} and order what you liked!"""

By going to ${bot_username}, you can use the registration desk.

There you can change your name with the help of a magic circle.
Or you can pay for access to the book of oblivion to forget your fighting skills and learn new ones."""
